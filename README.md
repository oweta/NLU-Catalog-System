# CountUgandaOccurrences Java Program

This Java program prompts the user (librarian) to enter a book description and counts how many times the word **"Uganda"** appears in the input, regardless of case.

---

## How It Works

- The program reads a full line of text input from the user.
- It converts the input string to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching.
- The input is split into words, ignoring common punctuation.
- It counts each occurrence of the exact word `"uganda"` and displays the total count.
